Outline 

Introduction 


Methods
- Experimental design

for methods chapter{ 
  - Sequencing,sequencing processing
  - Data anaylsis 
}


Results 
- Metrics 
  -interactive plots 
  - heatmap( Hover over with P value)
- Beta diversity 
  -interactive plots
- Coefficients (widget, lower, median upper posterior points)

- Second experimental design 
- Second metrics(w Comparison to first)
  - heatmap( Hover over with P value)
  -interactive plots 
- Second Beta diversity (w Comparison to first)
  -interactive plots
  - Coefficients (widget, lower, median upper posterior points)
  
Discussion 
Varaible efficency 
still useful 
Improved with imrpoved methodology
